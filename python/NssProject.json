Believing in this core value, our prime focus at VIDYA is to teach students from classes 4th to 10th and inculcate the fundamental concepts of all subjects, especially Mathematics and Science. Teaching is a wonderful activity, not only the students learn but we, as their tutor and guide, learn a lot too. Volunteers of our teaching projects have demonstrated to have a lot of fun while teaching the kids. We follow a simple and flexible technique of teaching with adoption of interactive learning methodologies, focused on activity based teaching and learning experience. Our contribution includes helping the kids with their regular homework and providing remedial sessions for their doubts and conceptual understanding of the subject. We do believe in 'all work and no play makes jack a dull boy'. Abiding by this, an equal importance is also given to co-curricular activities which not only freshen up minds of the students but also help them develop inter-personal skills. In order to achieve out targets and ensure a good learning exercise, our volunteers go to Kendriya Vidyalaya, near Kailash hostel on all weekdays from 3-5 pm.
